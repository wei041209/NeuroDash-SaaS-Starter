Dark-mode AI SaaS dashboard starter built with Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.

## Why this exists

Building SaaS dashboards from scratch is repetitive.

- Auth layouts  
- Sidebar structure  
- Responsive tables  
- Dark mode polish  
- Empty states  
- Basic workspace patterns  

This project provides a clean UI foundation so you can focus on product logic instead of rebuilding layout structure.
